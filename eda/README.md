# Exploratory analysis

This directory contains exploratory analysis scripts operating on
datasets produced by the ingestion layer.

Scripts in this directory are intended to:
- inspect dataset coverage and consistency
- compute basic descriptive statistics
- validate assumptions prior to feature engineering

They do not perform data ingestion or feature construction.
